# Algorithms-and-DS-in-Python
This notebook contains Algorithm Challenges in the [Khan Academy Algorithm Course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/). The course uses Javascript for its codes but I decided to implement the algorithms in Python myself.

There are implementations of:
### Search Algorithms
- Linear Sort
- Binary Search
### Sort Algorithms
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
### Recursive Algorithms
- Factorial
- Detecting Palindromes
- Recursive Power

Notebook still in development.
